# Make-a-donation-to-NGO
An Initiative to connect all the local Volunteer's with local NGO's


 # The problem ‘Giving Back’ solves:
 
        Every day, we encounter so many people who cannot afford a meal at least once a day. 
        So here comes ‘Giving Back’ which is an initiative to bring smile on every  struggling face.
        It focuses mainly on orphan care, environmental care and water body care.
        It is a network of volunteers who serve for the public registered under various NGO’s. 
        At the end of the day, ‘Giving Back’ provides smile to the poor and satisfaction to the donators.
        We cannot help everyone but everyone can help someone. The purpose of ‘Giving Back’ is to realize that we rise by lifting others.
