# Make-a-donation-to-NGO
An Initiative to connect all the local Volunteer's with local NGO's


 # The problem ‘Giving Back’ solves:
 
        Every day, we encounter so many people who cannot afford a meal at least once a day. </br>
        So here comes ‘Giving Back’ which is an initiative to bring smile on every  struggling face.</br>
        It focuses mainly on orphan care, environmental care and water body care.
        </br>It is a network of volunteers who serve for the public registered under various NGO’s. 
        <br>At the end of the day, ‘Giving Back’ provides smile to the poor and satisfaction to the donators.
        <br>We cannot help everyone but everyone can help someone. The purpose of ‘Giving Back’ is to realize that we rise by lifting others.
